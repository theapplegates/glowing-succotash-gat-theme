I'm not an OCD person when it comes to clean, but when I eat out I do expect things around me to be clear, after all if the front end of the house looks clean then more than likely the kitchen is clean.
With that being said, if you see something dirty, CLEAN IT. I watched several waitstaff use this and not do anything to clean it. It was obvious, and not just my viewing angle that I saw it.
Take pride in your work.
